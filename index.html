        <h1>Empowering Innovation</h1>
        <h4>Crafting Digital Experiences</h4>
  
        <p>
          The International Conference on Image Information Processing (ICIIP) has been a biennial conference at Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat, Solan, H.P., India since 2011 with sponsorship from IEEE. The conference has become a platform for computer science researchers from India and abroad to exchange research results and ideas on the foundations and applications of Image Processing and related areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The area of Imaging Science and Image Computing has grown enormously in the past decade, with wide-ranging applications encompassing multiple disciplines of Computer Science & Technology, Information Systems, Information Theory & Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, Cognition, Cybernetics, Medical Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology. It is primarily concerned with the process of image generation, visualization, structuring of large real-life image data, and analysis for classification, prediction based on machine learning, behavioral analysis, and virtualization. From the perspective of computer science and information technology, the subareas of Image Processing, Computer Vision, Image Security & Forensics, Pattern Recognition, and Computer Graphics form the core areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Eighth International Conference on Image Information Processing (ICIIP 2025) is being organized by and will be held at JUIT Waknaghat, Solan, H.P., India, during November 2025. This time, the theme of the conference is "Transforming Lives Through Intelligent Image Processing." However, ICIIP 2025 solicits original paper contributions in all related areas. The topics listed under each of these core areas are not meant to be exhaustive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conference proceedings that meet IEEE quality review standards may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. IEEE reserves the right not to publish any proceedings that do not meet these standards. Conference-related communications such as the conference website, email, and direct mail solicitations may not reference or guarantee inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers in academic institutions and R&D Research Labs, working in the related fields, and to use this as a forum to exchange views and ideas on these topics of current research.
        </p>
